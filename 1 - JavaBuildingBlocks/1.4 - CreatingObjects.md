## 1.4. Creating objects
Remember that an object is an instance of a class.

### 1.4.1. Constructors
There are two key points to note about the constructor: the name of the constructor matches the name of the class, and there’s no return type.

``` public void Chick() { } // NOT A CONSTRUCTOR ```

The purpose of a constructor is to initialize fi elds, although you can put any code in there. Another way to initialize fi elds is to do so directly on the line on which they’re declared.

For most classes, you don’t have to code a constructor—the compiler will supply a “do nothing” default constructor for you.

### 1.4.3. Instance Initializer Blocks

Sometimes code blocks are inside a method. These are run when the method is called. Other times, code blocks appear outside a method. These are called instance initializers

```
3: public static void main(String[] args) {
4: { System.out.println("Feathers"); }
5: }
6: { System.out.println("Snowy"); }
```
There are three code blocks and one instance initializer.

### 1.4.4. Order of Initialization

* Fields and instance initializer blocks are run in the order in which they appear in the file.
* The constructor runs after all fields and instance initializer blocks have run.

```
1: public class Chick {
2: private String name = "Fluffy";
3: { System.out.println("setting field"); }
4: public Chick() {
5: name = "Tiny";
6: System.out.println("setting constructor");
7: }
8: public static void main(String[] args) {
9: Chick chick = new Chick();
10: System.out.println(chick.name); } }
```
Running this example prints this:
```
setting field
setting constructor
Tiny
```

You can’t refer to a variable before it has been initialized:
```
{ System.out.println(name); } // DOES NOT COMPILE
private String name = "Fluffy";
```

```
public class Egg {
 public Egg() {
  number = 5;
 }
 public static void main(String[] args) {
   Egg egg = new Egg();
   System.out.println(egg.number);
 }
 private int number = 3;
 { number = 4; } }
 ```
If you answered 5, you got it right.
