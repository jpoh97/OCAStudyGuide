## 1.3. Understanding Package Declarations and Imports
Java puts classes in packages. These are logical groupings for classes.
The import statement tells the compiler which package to look in to find a class.

### 1.3.1. Wildcards
``` import java.util.*; // imports java.util.Random among other things ```
In this example, we imported java.util.Random and a pile of other classes. The * is a wildcard that matches all classes in the package. Every class in the java.util package is available to this program when Java compiles it. 
* You might think that including so many classes slows down your program, but it doesn’t. **The compiler figures out what’s actually needed**. Which approach you choose is personal preference. Listing the classes used makes the code easier to read, especially for new programmers. Using the wildcard can shorten the import list.

### 1.3.2. Redundant Imports
