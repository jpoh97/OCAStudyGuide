## Understanding Variable Scope

```
public void eat(int piecesOfCheese) {
 int bitesOfCheese = 1;
}
```

There are two local variables in this method. bitesOfCheese is declared inside the method. piecesOfCheese is called a method parameter. It is also local to the method. Both of these variables are said to have a scope local to the method. This means they cannot be used outside the method. Local variables can never have a scope larger than the method they are defi ned in. However, they can have a smaller scope. 

When you see a set of braces ({ }) in the code, it means you have entered a new block of code. Each block of code has its own scope. 

the rule for instance variables is easier: they are available as soon as they are defi ned and last for the entire lifetime of the object itself. The rule for class (static) variables is even easier: they go into scope when declared like the other variables types. However, they stay in scope for the entire life of the program.

The rules on scope:
* Local variables—in scope from declaration to end of block
* Instance variables—in scope from declaration until object garbage collected
* Class variables—in scope from declaration until program ends
