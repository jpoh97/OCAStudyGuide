## Declaring and Initializing Variables

A variable is a name for a piece of memory that stores data.

### Declaring Multiple Variables

You can declare many variables in the same declaration as long as they are all of the same type. You can also initialize any or all of those values inline.

``` int num, String value; // DOES NOT COMPILE ```

```
boolean b1, b2;
String s1 = "1", s2;
double d1, double d2; // NOT LEGAL
int i1; int i2;
int i3; i4; // NOT LEGAL
```

In the real world, please limit yourself to one declaration per statement and line. Your teammates will thank you for the readable code.

### Identifiers

The same rules for identifi ers apply to anything you are free to name, including variables, methods, classes, and fields.

There are only three rules to remember for legal identifiers:
* The name must begin with a letter or the symbol $ or _.
* Subsequent characters may also be numbers.
* You cannot use the same name as a Java reserved word. As you might imagine, a reserved word is a keyword that Java has reserved so that you are not allowed to use it. Remember that Java is case sensitive, so you can use versions of the keywords that only differ in case. Please don’t, though.

**_const_ and _goto_ aren’t actually used in Java.**
