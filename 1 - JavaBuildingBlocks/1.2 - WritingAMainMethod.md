## 1.2. Writing a main() method

A Java program begins execution with its main() method. A main() method is the gateway between the startup of a Java process, which is managed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), and the beginning of the programmer’s code.

* To compile and execute this code, type it into a fi le called Zoo.java and execute the following:
```
$ javac Zoo.java
$ java Zoo
```
To compile Java code, the fi le must have the extension .java. The name of the file must match the name of the class. The result is a fi le of bytecode by the same name, but with a .class filename extension. Bytecode consists of instructions that the JVM knows how to execute.

* A nonstatic main() method might as well be invisible from the point of view of the JVM.
* In general, it’s good practice to use void for methods that change an object’s state. In that sense, the main() method changes the program state from started to finished. 
*  If you want spaces inside an argument, you need to use quotes as in this example:
```
$ javac Zoo.java
$ java Zoo "San Diego" Zoo
```
* All command-line arguments are treated as String objects, even if they represent another data type:
```
$ javac Zoo.java
$ java Zoo Zoo 2
```
